## About HESTIA

### Problem Statement


According to sources, approximately 2% of the world's population, around 150 million people, is estimated to be homeless based on national reports. Homeless individuals often resist being counted or officially registered, with reluctance stemming from various concerns.
Homeless youth, fearing contact with authorities who might inform parents or place them in foster care, tend to avoid enumeration.
Parents experiencing homelessness may avoid being labeled as such to prevent potential consequences, such as losing custody of their children.
Homeless individuals, particularly those with mental health issues or substance abuse problems, may fear arrest or confinement in medical facilities for treatment, impacting their willingness to be registered. \
This number reflects equally as worse on the national scale. Reuters report more than four million people are currently homeless in India. This generally stems largely due to poverty, which is exacerbated by its large population. What is even more worse is that it is argued that the numbers are far greater than being measured, done mostly due to improper collection of data.\
On the regional scale in Assam, due to annual floods nearly 300,000 people are forced to reside in temporary relief camps. Suffering from poor resources, detaching from their families, or getting lost in floods with no method of reaching to their families. With no monetary support, they are forced to reside on the streets, suffering both physically and mentally.\
While appropriate measures are being taken by Government Agencies, NGOs, and Shelters, there has been a lack of integrating the general community in the process of helping people.

### Solution
